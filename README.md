## Descrição

The objective is to develop a simple FTP application that retrieves a specified file using the FTP protocol as described in RFC959.

It should take an argument that adopts the URL syntax, as described in RFC1738. Example:

download ftp://ftp.up.pt/pub/kodi/timestamp.txt

Where the URL path is

ftp://[<user>:<password>@]<host>/<url-path>
